I didn't create this sample Hbase MapReduce Code using Maven. I am restoring this because developers are often forget things in pom.xml so it is compliles correct but not running on hadoop.

This example code are written for pseduo dristributed hadoop mode, if you are running on distributed mode, you have to change hbase-site.xml to corresdoning one.
